"hello" ~ new kernel-level command added to generate dialog

This is a fun idea!  There may be some difficulty getting keyboard input
from the user at the kernel level, since I don't think fgets() or scanf()
functions are available at that level.  I know there's not printf() ~ you
will need to use "kprintf()" for output to the terminal from the kernel.
Do some research on it and see what you can come up with.

I love the idea!  This is a very worthy project and well-described in your
preliminary document.  I also like the forward thinking of having an actual
conversation with the computer in text, rather than in speech.

"Open the pod bay doors, HAL."
"I'm sorry, Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that."

Full credit earned.

Semester so far:
   homework01 100.00% * 10 points = 10.00 points
   delivery01 100.00% * 10 points = 10.00 points
                        total:   20.00 out of 20 = 100.00% = A-plus

Keep up the good work!
